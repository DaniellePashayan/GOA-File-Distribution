### GOA File Distribution

Because of the file naming structure, we were not able to work with GOA to put the files in their designated locations. Instead, Sutherland is sending all the files to one directory and the files are then parsed to their respective destinations. The json file can be edited to add further use cases, file names, and destinations as we expand to other types of file moves (like the outputs and source files)
